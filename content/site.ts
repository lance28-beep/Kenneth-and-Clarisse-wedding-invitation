    groom: `Kej and Macy met as block mates during their third year of college — just strangers sharing the same class schedules.

At first, they bonded over group projects, shared deadlines, and long walks between buildings. Friendship came naturally: late-night classes, bonded over long vacant hours, and the comfort of knowing someone always had their back.

But somewhere between laughter and quiet moments, something shifted. A lingering glance during classes, a heartbeat that raced a little faster after a casual touch, a sudden awareness that this person — this friend — felt like home.

Without planning it, they fell in love. What started as two block mates became two inseparable friends. And eventually, became two lovers who realized that the best relationships begin with friendship, built slowly, beautifully, and unexpectedly.`,
